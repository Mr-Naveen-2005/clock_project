I have created a website which shows the current time in 12 hours format, for the basic structure definition by html and the design of website is styled by CSS, and the function for getting the time is defined in JavaScript.	For getting current time Date () is used and which return a whole string of time and day, date in 24 hours format to separate it into different element I have declare different variable and constants and to convert 24 hours to 12 hours format I have used if statement.
